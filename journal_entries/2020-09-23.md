# Entry 17 - Wormhole fun

It was about a 20 foot drop into the tunnel and it's quite dark. As usual, Verril leads the way and I stay in the back. We are being quiet but before too long Verril steps on something, probably an old dry bone, that crunches loudly underfoot. We stop and listen. There is a moment of silence, then a low growl, followed by a caucophany of screeches. We are attacked by spiky-tentacled worm-things like we faught in that cave with the screeming mushrooms. Zackham had made a remark about my aim with my spells but my first attack on one of the worms was a powerful shot directly in its 'face' and its whole head just exploded. Stupidly, I gloated a bit. I say stupidly, because I hot almost nothing but rock for the rest of the fight. The small worms don't give us too much trouble but there is a huge one as well, and it's a bit tougher. I manage to hit it a few times but am still mostly missing. When we think the beast is almost vanquished it grabs Iankul in its mouth and tries to run away. It's felled by a clutch shot by Zackham before it escapes and Dezo swoops in the heal Iankul before it's too late.
