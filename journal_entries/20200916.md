# Entry 16 - Welcom back Xaphan!
<span class="journaldate">2020/09/16</span>

We are pretty beat up after fighting that plant monster so we take a long rest to recover. I wasn't in that bad of shape so I take this opportunity to re-summon Xaphan. I missed the ugly little guy. I've got plans for making better use of him while exploring that doesn't put him in so much danger.

During Zackham's watch he yells to wake us up and is rambling about someone watching us. We havea a brief discussion about what to do about Zackham's histeria and decide to just ignore him while he raves. We removed some vines from the plant monster and return to the Circle of Hunters. We decide to give the monter bits to Loobamud directly instead of involving the sovereigns. We're on Basidia's side but we don't want Phylo to know that.

Next on our list is the worm-cave-thing. Loobamub sends a couple guides with us and we head out. We reach a hole and head down into it.
