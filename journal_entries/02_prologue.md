# Prologue

My first adventure began in Port Crawl, a small town in the southern part of the Sword Coast. I joined a group of adventurers who were on their way to explore the recently found Lost Tomb of Pav the Magnificent. I didn't know what to expect, I just wanted to get some experience and the folks I joined with seemed to know what they were doing.

+ Dorn Ironskull, dwarf (male)
+ Tav Orin, half-elf (male)
+ Vawen Loww'elai, elf (female)

While exploring the tomb we found a collapsed tunnel and decided to explore it. Is this tunnel we were ambushed by drow who managed to subdue my entire party. They knocked me out during the battle and I woke up in some kind of prison cart that was little more than a big box attached to a carriage that was stuffed with prisoners. My hands and legs were shackled to a collar and belt so I could barely move.

I don't know how long I was in the box but it felt like a very long time. I would guess at least a full day.

After what felt like forever just sitting in the box as we rolled along I started to hear the buildup of some kind of droning sound. It gets so loud it seems to vibrate the carriage.

Soon after I start to hear ear splitting shrieks and panicked screams in a language I don't understand and then the carriage seemed to pick up speed. After a sort while the carriage stops abruptly and I can hear sounds of fighting.

I hear the roar of what sounds like a large beast while the shrieking and fighting continues.

Abruptly the shrieking stops and something is thudding against the carriage and it starts to shake. Suddenly the roof is half ripped off and flung away. I see a pair of bulbous glowing spheres (eyes?) before what's left of the roof collapses and traps me in the corner. The roof seems to protect me from whatever is now in the carriage, but it also hit me in the head when it collapsed. Just as I'm passing out I see Dorn slumped unconcious with a large gash in his head and I hear Vawen scream, as well as the sounds of other prisoners dying.
